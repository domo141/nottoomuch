I used to use notmuch on Scientific Linux 6.2 (like rhel6) system,
from 2021 to end of may 2022 (notmuch 0.6 - notmuch 0.36).

At some point I could not continue compiling notmuch on that
particular system, so I had to create these build containers
to get the job done.

But no more, so I moved these neat(?) scripts here,
there may be some reference value here...
