branches in this git repo
-------------------------

master
''''''
    “release quality” material

dogfood
'''''''
    bleeding edge / undocumented hacks -- branch i use to run my stuff.
    this branch will get /forced updates/ often, either when this branch
    is rebased on top of current master or when i amend this to look how
    the outcome looks from a web browser.

df-yymm
'''''''
    a ‛dogfood’ branch, HEAD commit containing the same /tree/ object
    than ‛dogfood’ -- i.e. the file contents are the same. these branches
    don't get /forced updated/ but these vanish after a new df-yymm branch
    has existed for a few months... rebasing to these branches are 'safer'
    than to ‛dogfood’.


if anyone ever desires to contribute to this repo, it is easier to deal
with ‛master’ and ‛df-yymm’ branches than ‛dogfood’.


----

ps: guess how many

    git commit --amend -C HEAD README.rst && git push --force

lines i've executed in ‛dogfood’ branch so far (HEAD commit contained
changes to `README.rst` only).

pps: actually the above works also when checking ‛master’ content; the
command line just needs to end with ``git push --force origin HEAD:test``.
